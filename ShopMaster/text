### Notes
- **Cart and Checkout**: These are placeholder views. Implementing a full cart system would require additional models (e.g., `Cart`, `Order`), controllers, and logic for session or database-based cart storage.
- **File Storage**: Configure the `public` disk in `config/filesystems.php` for image uploads:
  ```php
  'disks' => [
      'public' => [
          'driver' => 'local',
          'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
          'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
          'visibility' => 'public',
      ],
  ],

### Key Updates from Previous Response
- **Category Seeder**: The `CategorySeeder` is updated to prepopulate the `categories` table with "Electronics", "Clothing", and "Books" as specified in the `categories` parameter.
- **Database Seeder**: The `DatabaseSeeder` calls the `CategorySeeder` to ensure categories are seeded before products, and sample products are assigned to these categories (using IDs 1, 2, and 3).
- **Prompt Integration**: The generated prompt now includes the specific category list and seeder code, making it clear that the categories table should be prepopulated with the provided entries.

If you need further enhancements, such as implementing the cart and checkout functionality, additional controllers (e.g., for categories), or specific API endpoints, let me know, and I can provide those details!
